config TMP102_SENSOR
	bool "TMP102 temp sensor support"
	depends on OMAP_THERMAL && I2C
	help
	  Enabling this config will give support for the tmp102
	  temp sensor.

config TMP103_SENSOR
	bool "OMAP TMP103 temp sensor support"
	depends on THERMAL_FRAMEWORK && OMAP_THERMAL && I2C
	help
	  Enabling this config will give support for the tmp103

config OMAP_DIE_TEMP_SENSOR
	bool "Texas Instruments OMAP4+ on-die sensor support"
	depends on OMAP_BANDGAP && OMAP_THERMAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get thermal support for the Texas Instruments
	  OMAP4+ SoC family. The current chip supported are:
	  - OMAP4460, OMAP4470, OMAP5430

	  This includes alert interrupts generation and also the TSHUT
	  support.

	depends on OMAP_THERMAL && TWL6030_GPADC
	help
	  Enabling this config will give support for the thermistor
	  temp sensor for the OMAP platform.

config CASE_TEMP_SENSOR
	bool "Case temp sensor support"
	depends on THERMAL_FRAMEWORK
	help
	  Enabling this config will give support for the case
	  temp sensor for the OMAP platform.
